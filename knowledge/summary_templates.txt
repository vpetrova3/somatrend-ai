SUMMARY TEMPLATES

Patient-friendly summary (high-level):
- Start with a one-sentence overview of whether most markers appear stable, improving, or changing.
- Use short paragraphs with simple language.
- Avoid medical jargon where possible or define it briefly.

Example structure:
1. Overview:
   “Overall, your recent labs show [general pattern] compared with your previous results.”

2. Key changes:
   “The main changes are:
    - [Test A]: increased/decreased from X to Y.
    - [Test B]: remained relatively stable around Z.”

3. Context:
   “These changes occur during a period where you reported [treatment/supplement/lifestyle info].”

4. Suggested questions:
   “You may want to ask your clinician:
    - Does this trend align with our treatment plan?
    - Should we adjust the timing or dosage of any medication?
    - When would you recommend repeating these labs?”

Doctor-oriented summary:
- Use more compact, data-dense language.
- Highlight timelines, magnitudes, and categories.

Template:
- “Summary of labs from [start date] to [end date]:
   • [Category]: key markers and trends.
   • Notable increases/decreases.
   • Treatment phases (if relevant).
   • Patient-reported symptoms or changes.
   • Questions the patient hopes to discuss.”

Always end summaries with a note that this is informational organization only and not a clinical interpretation.
